     <p> Mr Bean is my my favorite character. When I was a kid  and watched his shows,he made me laugh so much. His real name was Rowan Atkinson.He was born on 06-01-1955 in Durham in the state of England, United Kingdom. He was an english film actor, comedian, screenwriter, radio artist, theatre actor, television actor and voice artist who is best known for his work in Hollywood industry. When he passed away on july 17 2018,it made me very sad. But his legacy follows and so is his work.
